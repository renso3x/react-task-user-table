1. Create a github public repo and send us the repo url when you are ready to submit.
2. Create a project to build a web app to show user data (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helianbobo/react-task-user-table/master/users.json) in the web page. The project should make use webpack to test the web app locally and build for production deployment.
3. The web app should show users in a table. The columns are "Name", "Gender" and "Age".
4. The web app should have a bar chart to show number of female and male users. The x-axis should be gender, male or female. And the y-axis should be number of users. You can use chartjs or any lib you prefer.
